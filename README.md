CreativeMe is a small application that I created that allows users to create their own works, learn from interactive tutorials, and get ideas for how to write better. Users can learn and write a plethora of writing pieces ranging from sonnets, to personal essays for college admission.

## Features

- **Feature 1: Creating Personal Works with Tutorials**

  Upon creating a new work, the user is given a field to enter a title, a list of writing types to select, and an option to request an interactive tutorial. Based on the user's selection a tutorial will be presented and afterwards, the user may type and save their work. Each work can be marked as 'favorite' and sorted between type, favorites, and alphabetical order on the home screen. The homepage also displays all the user's work in a manner that can be shuffled between swiftly.

- **Feature 2: Learning with Flashcards and Interactives**

  When requested, users can view an interactive tutorial of the writing type they choose. This often contains flip-able cards that give tips or hints on how to write. Moreover, there are often more than one slide to the tutorial, which allows the user to go back and forth between learning objectives. If the user wants to simply view a tutorial without creating a work, they may access this feature from the homepage, in which each tutorial can be selected from the neatly presented, 3d-like scrollable display.

- **Feature 3: Saving Work and Writing in a Clean Space**
  ![CreativeMe - Write](https://github.com/sarahak1786/CreativeMe/assets/127272701/7b184edd-3317-473b-80ba-b0b7a9fe8800)
  Often writers can be intimidated by online text editors including Google Docs and Microsoft Word. CreativeMe deliberately presents a simple, colorful text editor for the users that reminds them of the type of work they selected and shows an option to favorite their work. With full privacy and anonymous work, the user can write in a manner that blocks out unwanted stress or distraction to their work. If the user feels that they are lacking writing inspiration, they may go to the homepage and try writing to a random prompt.
